// Based on emscripten.rs from https://github.com/therocode/rust_emscripten_main_loop
// This file interacts with the Emscripten API to provide a scheduling mechanism for main looping.

// Since Emscripten only schedules the looping to be executed later by the browser, we need to make sure that the
// data object looped upon lives as long as the looping is scheduled, as well as being properly destroyed afterwards.

// The Emscripten function used for this is emscripten_set_main_loop which will do the scheduling as well as terminate the current code flow
// to prevent scopes from being exited which would cause objects to be destroyed prematurely. To be able to destroy the data object properly
// as looping is terminated, the object is stored in thread_local storage.
